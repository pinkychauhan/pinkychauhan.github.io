      <p>The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness.
        Data for this report is collected from people in over 150 countries.
        Each variable measured reveals a populated-weighted average score on a scale running from 0 to 10 that is tracked over time and compared against other countries.
        These variables currently include: real GDP per capita, family/social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.
        Each country is also compared against a hypothetical nation called Dystopia.
        Dystopia represents the lowest national averages for each key variable and is, along with residual error, used as a regression benchmark.

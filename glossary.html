          <b>What do the factors (like Economy, Generosity, etc.) describe?</b><br/>

          Economy (GDP per Capita), Family/Social Support, Healthy Life Expectancy, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity, Trust and Perception of Government Corruption describe the extent to which these factors contribute
          in evaluating the happiness in each country.<br/>
          If you add all these factors up, you get the happiness score.
        </li>

        <li><b>What is Dystopia?</b><br/>

          Dystopia is an imaginary country that has the world’s least-happy people.
          The purpose in establishing Dystopia is to have a benchmark against which all countries can be favorably compared (no country performs more poorly than Dystopia) in
          terms of each of the six key variables. The lowest scores observed for the six key variables, therefore, characterize Dystopia.
          Since life would be very unpleasant in a country with the
          world’s lowest incomes, lowest life expectancy, lowest generosity, most corruption, least freedom and least social support, it is referred to as “Dystopia,” in contrast to Utopia.
        </li>
        <li><b>What are the residuals?</b><br/>

          The residuals, or unexplained components, differ for each country, reflecting the extent to which the six variables either over- or under-explain average 2014-2016 life evaluations. These residuals have an average value of approximately
          zero over the whole set of countries.
